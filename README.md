## 📬 Sample Phishing Email

---

## ⚠️ Phishing Indicators Identified

1. **Spoofed Sender Address**  
   - Email appears to be from PayPal but the domain is `secure-paypal.com`, not `paypal.com`.

2. **Suspicious Link**  
   - Link text looks legitimate, but the actual URL is `http://paypal-account-verify.com/login` which is not an official PayPal domain.

3. **Urgency and Threats**  
   - Uses threatening language: “your account will be permanently suspended” to trigger panic and quick action.

4. **Generic Greeting**  
   - Uses “Dear Customer” instead of addressing by name, which is typical in phishing emails.

5. **Grammatical Red Flags**  
   - Slightly unnatural phrasing and tone (“verify your identity by clicking the secure link below”).

6. **Unusual Domain**  
   - The domain `paypal-account-verify.com` mimics PayPal but is clearly fraudulent.

This is a classic phishing email that uses email spoofing, fake URLs, and social engineering techniques (fear and urgency) to trick the recipient into clicking a malicious link. It does not originate from an authentic PayPal server and is clearly crafted to steal user credentials.
